# Arcade Native Agnostic Layer

This repository contains the standard for a common implementation for the
Epitech project 'Arcade'

> Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to
> play and keeps a register of player scores.  
> To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plate-form at run-time,
> your graphics libraries and your games must be implemented as dynamic
> libraries, loaded at run-time.  
> Each GUI available for the program must be used as a shared library that
> will be loaded and used dynamically by the main  program.

This repository contains the interface that you need to implement for your
Arcade to be ANAL compliant.  
Specific instructions and examples can be found [here](./imp_examples.md)
